      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>
        When neural engineers are developing technologies such as neural prosthetics, one important
        aspect to consider is the restoration of sensory feedback. Engineers can use many different
        ways to provide sensory information to a prosthetic user, but it is important to quantify
        how well the chosen sensory feedback modality works. One way to measure the usability of
        sensory feedback is by using the <b>Stroop task</b>. The Stroop task is taken from a study
        by John Ridley Stroop in 1935, which found that people responded faster to congruent stimuli
        than incongruent stimuli. In the study, Stroop presented subjects with names of colors
        written in colors that either matched the name (congruent) or did not match the name
        (incongruent). He asked subjects to report the color of the word and not the name of the
        word, and found that subjects responded faster to the congruent words than the incongruent
        words. Try the Stroop task out for yourself and see how your reaction times measure up!

      <h1>Instructions</h1>
      <p>
        For each word that appears, press the correct key corresponding to the <b>color</b> of the
        word, not the word itself. 
      </p>
      <p style="color:green">1-Green</p>
      <p style="color:red">2-Red</p>
      <p style="color:blue">3-Blue</p>
      <p style="color:yellow">4-Yellow</p>
      <p>
        The graph will show your reaction times in real time. You can press "End Session" to end
        your session, upon which you can choose to save your data as a CSV file. If you do not press
        the "End Session" button, the session will end after 500 trials.
