        How many things can you remember? The n-back task measures the limits of working
        memory. In the n-back task, subjects are presented with a series of cues (letters, in this
        case). Subjects are told to indicate when they see the same letter <i>n</i> letters apart,
        where <i>n</i> is specified by the experimenter. Thus, if the subject is presented with the
        letters "A, B, A" during a 2-back (<i>n</i> = 2), the subject will indicate that there was a
        cue match because the As are two cues apart. As <i>n</i> increases, the task becomes harder.
